## Viewing Slides

There are a few ways to check out the slides.  I'm still working on a PDF view, but having a little trouble since I used CSS animations.  Oops!

While viewing, if you press the `p` key, you can get the presenter notes (which I didn't really use while presenting).  It'll at least contain the commands I ran during the various demos.
